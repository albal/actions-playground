# Complex Build Pipeline Documentation

## Overview
The `complex-build-pipeline.yml` workflow demonstrates a sophisticated CI/CD pipeline with both parallel and sequential execution patterns. It simulates a real-world build pipeline using echo commands to represent various build stages.

## Workflow Features

### 🎯 Triggers
- **Manual trigger** (`workflow_dispatch`): Allows manual execution with custom inputs
- **Push trigger**: Automatically runs on pushes to main/master branches
- **Pull request trigger**: Runs on PRs to main/master branches

### ⚙️ Input Parameters
- **environment**: Choose between 'staging' or 'production' deployment target
- **skip_tests**: Boolean option to skip the entire test phase for faster builds

### 🏗️ Pipeline Architecture

#### Phase 1: Setup (Parallel Execution)
```
environment-setup ─┐
dependency-cache ──┼─→ Phase 2
code-quality ──────┘
```
- **environment-setup**: Generates build version and cache keys
- **dependency-cache**: Simulates dependency downloading and caching
- **code-quality**: Runs linting and security scans

#### Phase 2: Build (Parallel Execution)
```
frontend-build ─┐
backend-build ──┼─→ Phase 3
database-build ─┘
```
- **frontend-build**: Compiles TypeScript, processes assets, creates bundles
- **backend-build**: Builds services, APIs, and microservices
- **database-build**: Generates and validates migration scripts

#### Phase 3: Test (Parallel Execution)
```
unit-tests ─────┐
integration-tests ──┼─→ Phase 4
e2e-tests ──────┘
```
- **unit-tests**: Frontend, backend, and database unit tests
- **integration-tests**: API and service integration testing
- **e2e-tests**: Browser-based end-to-end testing

#### Phase 4: Package (Parallel Execution)
```
package-application ─┐
generate-documentation ──┼─→ Phase 5
```
- **package-application**: Creates deployment packages
- **generate-documentation**: Generates API and deployment docs

#### Phase 5: Deploy (Sequential Execution)
```
deploy-staging → smoke-tests → deploy-production
```
- **deploy-staging**: Deploys to staging environment
- **smoke-tests**: Validates staging deployment
- **deploy-production**: Deploys to production (conditional)

#### Phase 6: Notifications (Conditional)
```
notify-success (if all succeeded)
notify-failure (if any failed)
```

### 🔗 Job Dependencies
The workflow uses the `needs` keyword to create complex dependency chains:
- 13 out of 19 jobs have dependencies
- Jobs can depend on multiple other jobs: `needs: [job1, job2, job3]`
- Output passing between jobs using `outputs` and `${{ needs.job.outputs.value }}`

### 🌍 Environment Protection
- **staging**: No additional protection
- **production**: Requires manual approval and specific conditions

### 📊 Key Metrics Simulated
- **Build times**: Realistic sleep durations to simulate actual build times
- **Artifact sizes**: Example package sizes (15.2 MB frontend, 42.1 MB backend)
- **Test counts**: Realistic test numbers (127 frontend, 89 backend, 45 database)
- **Version tracking**: Build version passed through the entire pipeline

## Usage Examples

### Manual Execution
1. Go to Actions tab in GitHub
2. Select "Complex Build Pipeline" 
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Choose environment and test options
5. Monitor the visual pipeline execution

### Automatic Execution
- Push to main/master branch triggers full pipeline
- Pull requests trigger pipeline with staging deployment only

### Conditional Execution
- Production deployment only occurs on main/master or manual trigger with production environment
- Tests can be skipped using the `skip_tests` input parameter
- Failure notifications only sent if pipeline fails

## Learning Outcomes
This workflow demonstrates:
- ✅ Parallel job execution within phases
- ✅ Sequential job execution between phases
- ✅ Complex dependency management with `needs`
- ✅ Output passing between jobs
- ✅ Conditional job execution
- ✅ Environment-based deployments
- ✅ Input parameter handling
- ✅ Realistic build stage simulation
- ✅ Proper error handling and notifications

## Performance Characteristics
- **Total execution time**: ~15 minutes (simulated)
- **Parallel efficiency**: Up to 3 jobs running simultaneously per phase
- **Resource usage**: 1 runner per job (19 runners at peak)
- **Artifact handling**: Demonstrates artifact upload/download patterns
